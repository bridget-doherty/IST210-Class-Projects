        "I was able to complete this diagram by completing it little by little with each sentence. First, I created the pet and the enclosure entities and included some attributes for both. I connected them through a foreign key in the pet entity, which was location. I also have the pet entity connected to the food entity because pets are fed food. I connected customer with food, food transaction, and adoption transaction because the customer completes all of these transactions. I have adoption transaction connected to pets because they are the product that is being adopted. Finally, I have food transaction connected to food because that is the product that is going to be sold. In addition, I also added a RewardPoints attribute for customer, adoption transaction, and food transaction, as the points that are earned in the transaction entities will be given to the customer as a part of the loyalty program."
